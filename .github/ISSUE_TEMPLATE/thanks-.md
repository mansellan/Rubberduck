Our use of GitHub "issues" includes meta-discussions, feature ideas, bugs of course, ...it's also perfectly fine to make one just to drop a "thanks!" to the team, too! Got a story to tell? We want to hear it!

Thank *you* for your support! Rubberduck exists *because* it's free, open-source software. [Here are the real heroes](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/stargazers), join them!
